# Protfolio for developer using NUXT JS  

This portfolio starter pack is made using NUXT. The data on the portfolio is directly linked to a JSON file. Any changes to the portfolio can be made in the JSON file. The changes will then be reflected on to the portfolio. 
This allows you to customize your own personal portfolio that can be used for applying to jobs or other personal uses.
